            <p>Marie Salomea Skłodowska Curie (/ˈkjʊəri/ KEWR-ee;[3] French: [kyʁi]; Polish:
                [kʲiˈri]), born Maria Salomea Skłodowska (Polish: [ˈmarja salɔˈmɛa skwɔˈdɔfska]; 7 November 1867 – 4
                July
                1934), was a Polish and naturalized-French physicist and chemist who conducted pioneering research on
                radioactivity. As the first of the Curie family legacy of five Nobel Prizes, she was the first woman to
                win
                a Nobel Prize, the first person and the only woman to win the Nobel Prize twice, and the only person to
                win
                the Nobel Prize in two scientific fields. She was the first woman to become a professor at the
                University of
                Paris in 1906.

                She was born in Warsaw, in what was then the Kingdom of Poland, part of the Russian Empire. She studied
                at
                Warsaw's clandestine Flying University and began her practical scientific training in Warsaw. In 1891,
                aged
                24, she followed her elder sister Bronisława to study in Paris, where she earned her higher degrees and
                conducted her subsequent scientific work. In 1895 she married the French physicist Pierre Curie, and she
                shared the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics with him and with the physicist Henri Becquerel for their
                pioneering
                work developing the theory of "radioactivity"—a term she coined.[5][6] In 1906 Pierre Curie died in a
                Paris
                street accident. Marie won the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for her discovery of the elements polonium
                and
                radium, using techniques she invented for isolating radioactive isotopes.
