            <p>Marie Salomea Sk≈Çodowska Curie (/Ààkj ä…ôri/ KEWR-ee;[3] French: [ky Åi]; Polish: [k ≤iÀàri]), born Maria
                Salomea Sk≈Çodowska (Polish: [Ààmarja sal…îÀàm…õa skw…îÀàd…îfska]; 7 November 1867 ‚Äì 4 July 1934), was a Polish
                and naturalized-French physicist and chemist who conducted pioneering research on radioactivity. As the
                first of the Curie family legacy of five Nobel Prizes, she was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the
                first person and the only woman to win the Nobel Prize twice, and the only person to win the Nobel Prize
                in two scientific fields. </p>

            <p>She was the first woman to become a professor at the University of Paris in
                1906. She was born in Warsaw, in what was then the Kingdom of Poland, part of the Russian Empire. She
                studied at Warsaw's clandestine Flying University and began her practical scientific training in Warsaw.
                In 1891, aged 24, she followed her elder sister Bronis≈Çawa to study in Paris, where she earned her
                higher degrees and conducted her subsequent scientific work. </p>

            <p>In 1895 she married the French physicist
                Pierre Curie, and she shared the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics with him and with the physicist Henri
                Becquerel for their pioneering work developing the theory of "radioactivity"‚Äîa term she coined.[5][6] In
                1906 Pierre Curie died in a Paris street accident. Marie won the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for her
                discovery of the elements polonium and radium, using techniques she invented for isolating radioactive
                isotopes.</p>
